# User research project elections
The user research focuses on the visual attractiveness, clarity and readability of different pages: the homepage, the login/registration page, the page with election results and the forum.
## Valuable insights
- Users found the homepage quite boring and lacked a clear call to action; points for improvement were adding more white space, shrinking and better aligning buttons, and improving the fonts.

- On the login/registration page, the unsettled alignment of the login and registration elements was criticized; suggestions included using the same formats and fonts, and considering a single login element with a separate registration link.

- The election results page was generally received positively, but users suggested a clearer contrast in the chart, a larger and clearer "Election results 2023" title, and the ability to select multiple parties.

- Feedback on the forum mainly concerned the size of the forum posts, the need for more white space, and the lack of clarity about responding to specific comments; suggestions were to increase the comment fields and add a "reply" button with a dropdown menu for replies.

- Overarching, users on multiple pages advocated improving fonts, better alignment of elements, and adding more white space for a quieter and clearer design.

- The readability of the text was mentioned on several pages as a point of attention, with suggestions to adjust the text size and improve contrast, especially for older users.
