## Learning Process

### What was learned
- How to create an entity class in Spring Boot
- How to create a controller class in Spring Boot
- How to create a service class in Spring Boot
- How to create a repository class in Spring Boot
- How to create a Vue.js component
- How to fetch data from an API in Vue.js
- How to display data in a table in Vue.js
- How to insert data from an API into a table in Vue.js

### Challenges faced
- During the creation of the VotingResult class, I faced the while fetching the data that the response in postman returned `NULL`.
- In the beginning it was difficult to understand the entire sturcture of the backend. (I.E. What is the purpose of controller, service, repo etc.)
- I had cost me a while to figure out how and where to get started with the User Story.

### Solutions/Improvements
- The solution for the `NULL` in postman, was because in the database a field called candidateId was empty. This was because national votes only had a partyId and regionCode. Hibernate wants all values to have a value so when one column is empty, the respons will automatically be `NULL`. This problem was fixed by creating a new table called `VotesPerYear`, which only have the columns for `partyId`, `regionCode` and `value`. Now after fetching the data, it returns te desired values.
- On the first Wednesday of sprint 3, we decided to stay on-campus to work on the project. Here we tackled these problems by discussing with each other what the project should look like. I also had the opportunity to ask in detail how the backend was structured and how I could implement my User Story.
- As discussed in the point above, I decided to start creating an entity and model for the VotingResult class. From here i started working until it was finished.

## Notes/Additional Information
- [Link to the User Story](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/semester-3-hbo-ict/onderwijs/student-projecten/2024-2025/out-r-se-cs/semester-1/neeluuteehii55/-/issues/15)
- Installed multiple new packages, such as Axios and Chart.js. Install scripts will be located underneath.
- Created a new table in the database called `VotesPerYear` to store the data for the User Story.
- Still need to update remaining data in `votingresult` DB table before working on new filter systems.
